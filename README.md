# Tableau_Project
Analysis over Book Sales Data and Visualizing it.

1. Developed an interactive Tableau dashboard that visualized book sales data, leading to actionable business insights.
  
2. The project involved cleaning and preparing the dataset using Excel, creating various charts to address business problems, and integrating these into a comprehensive Tableau dashboard.

3. A Tableau story was then crafted to effectively present the insights derived from the dashboard.

The final dashboard is showed below for reference
